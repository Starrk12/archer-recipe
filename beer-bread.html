        <h1>Beer Bread</h1>
        <p>It is one of the easiest things to make and who doesn't like fresh bread. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="items">
        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A can of beer</li>
            <li>3 cups of flour</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Method of preparation</h3>
        <p>mix, miX, mIX, mIXS!</p>
        <p> Put it in a bread pan and throw it in the oven at 375 for an hour. That's it.</p>
        <h4>UPDATE 1</h4>
        <p>Success! The bread is crusty, with a dense but soft interior. Slightly more noticeable flour taste than yeast-risen bread, but that's neither surprising, nor a bad thing.
            Used whole wheat flour, a bottle of New Belgium's Snow Day Winter Ale, and also added 1Tbsp of rolled oats and flax seed ecah, and, just for kicks, about 1tsp fresh thyme. The thyme really worked well, both for aroma and a subtle flavor.
            This may become my new method of baking bread. A softer, squishier texture than standard yeast-risen dough... but it works well, and cuts about 12 hours off the prep time!
