    <h1>Carnitas</h1>
    <p>Picture this: Mounds of juicy, tender, crispy-edged pieces of pork just waiting to be tucked into freshly made tortillas</p>
    <p> or piled on a plate along with rice and beans. This carnitas recipe is the classic way to make themâ€”well, almost. </p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> cups water</li>
        <li> pounds fatty pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 orange, cut into 2 pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pork lard or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweetened condensed milk</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Method of preparation</h3>
    <p>I make some pretty good slow cooked pork, but it's just not as good as I can get in authentic Mexican restaurants.</p>  
    <p>What's the secret? I use some pretty good spices and marinades, and brown the pork before cooking.</p>
    <p>It always comes out super tender but just not as flavorful as I'd like.</p>
